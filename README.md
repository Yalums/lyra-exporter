**A personal project co-created with Claude.** This is a user-friendly, feature-rich tool designed to help you manage and export conversations from AI platforms. Filter through hundreds of conversations to find exactly what you need—from images and thinking processes to attachments, Artifacts, and tool call details.

## Features

- **Conversation Management**: Load multiple conversation JSON files from Claude, Gemini, NotebookLM, and Google AI Studio. **Supports exporting entire Claude account data for comprehensive management**
- **Smart Search**: Search message content, find conversations with image attachments, thinking processes, and Artifacts
- **Tagging System**: Mark messages as completed, important, or deleted, with format preservation during export
- **Flexible Export**: Export to Markdown format with batch export support
- **Branch Detection**: Automatically detect and visualize conversation branches
- **Rich Content Parsing**: Intelligently recognize image attachments, thinking processes, and Markdown syntax
